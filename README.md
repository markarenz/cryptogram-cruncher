# Cryptogram Cruncher

## About
This is a tool to make solving cryptograms easier. It provides analytics on the cyphertext to assist with solving puzzles: double letters, frequency, one letter words, etc. You can also create your own cryptograms.

## Running
Simply run ``npm start``

## Next Steps
If I ever get back to this, I may add a backend to handle the automated guessing and an OCR function
